## General info
It is one of the Data Analysing projects which is suppoused to hone my skills in that category.

Main goals of the project were:
* How to use histograms to visualise distributions.
* How to superimpose histograms on top of each other.
* How to use a to smooth out kinks in a histogram and visualise a distribution with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE).
* How to use scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values.

As a notebook I used Datalore from Jetbrains.

It's one of the projects from [Angela's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
